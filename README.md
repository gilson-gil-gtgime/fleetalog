Fleetalog 1.0

This project was developed to show the coding style of Gilson Gil.

It shows:
 - the architecture based on MVVM;
 - project folders setup;
 - use of major swift features;
 - use of consolidated third party libraries;

Because of lack of time, only worked for a total of 6 hours, a lot was left out of the project, unfortunately;
If I had the time, I would localize texts and storyboards, finish the favourite items feature, present error or other feedback to the user, share items.

Well, thanks!
